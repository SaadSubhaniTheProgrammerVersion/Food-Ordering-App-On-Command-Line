# Food-Ordering-App-On-Command-Line
This is my first semester project in C language in which me and my 2 groupmates made a food managing system on command line.
It has a simple .c file which you can easily run using the gc++ compier or run the code on any free online compiler.
The files in the folder are the files for the existing restaurants which can be created easily within the program.
If you only clone the .c file and run it then you will have to create all restaurants and users newly.

But if you run the .exe along with all the files in the same directory then the existing restaurants and users will also 
be available for use.


Enjoy!!!
